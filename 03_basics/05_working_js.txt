    Javascript is Single Threaded              
        Javascript Execution Context:
                1) Global Execution Context (this)
                2) Functional Execution Context 
                3) Eval Execution Context
        
        phase: 1) Memory Creation Phase (Memory allocation)
               2) Execution phase

        Code Blocks: 
                  let val1 = 10
                  let val2 = 5

                  function addNum(num1, num2) {
                      let total = num1 + num2;
                      return total
                  }

                  let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
                  let result2 = addNum(10,2)



    Steps: 1) Global Execution or environment
           2) Memory phase:
                 val1 -> undefined
                 val2 -> undefined
                 addnum -> definition
                 result1 -> undefined
                 result2 -> undefined
            
           3) Execution phase
                val1 <- 10
                val2 <- 5

                addNum ----> [new variable environment + Execution 
                               thread]
                result1 <- 15              

                               3.1) Memory Phase
                                     val1 -> undefined 
                                     val2 -> undefined
                                     total -> undefined
                               3.2) Execution Context
                                     num1 <- 10
                                     num2 <- 5
                                     total <- 15
                                 // here total will return to global executon Context
                                After that this block will get deleted
                
                result2 <- 12    [new variable environment + Execution 
                               thread]
                               3.1) Memory Phase
                                     val1 -> undefined 
                                     val2 -> undefined
                                     total -> undefined
                               3.2) Execution Context
                                     num1 <- 10
                                     num2 <- 2
                                     total <- 12



Call Stack :- Similar to another language like in recursion i.e. LIFO
